# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
We scrape data from Twitter to compare the sentiment towards a German politican in the aftermath of two different events. In the first instance media resonance seemed to be quite positive, in the second more of the opposite.
Our plan is too see if we can validate that perception with an analysis of 10000 Tweets which were posted in the days after the respective event.
We also try to extraxt significant nouns and compare the frequency in the postive and negative class.
